"""Pure, side-effect-free threshold binarisation and aggregate prediction for the report-v2 layer.

This module turns a plain ``{finding_id: score_or_None}`` mapping into an immutable
:class:`PredictionResult` by resolving an adapter-owned :class:`~report_v2.projects.base.ThresholdPolicy`
through the Task-04 require-project-context guard and binning each covered finding with the explicit ``gt``
(strict greater-than) operator before aggregating under the policy's ``any_positive`` rule. It deliberately
contains **no** ORM, no Django import and no database access: predictions are *computed values*, never
stored labels, and nothing here may touch ``lunit_binarised`` or any other persisted column.

Design rules relied upon by the rest of the layer:

* Every public entry point routes identifier resolution through
  :func:`report_v2.projects.registry.require_project_context`, so an unknown or foreign reference fails with
  the *typed* errors already defined in :mod:`report_v2.projects.base`. There is no default policy version,
  no fallback project and no silent substitution anywhere.
* Malformed configuration (a bad score scale, an unsupported operator/aggregate, a non-numeric or
  out-of-range per-finding default) and malformed *input* (an uncovered finding id, a non-finite or
  out-of-range score, a boolean masquerading as a score) are rejected loudly with a dedicated
  :class:`PolicyEvaluationError` subclass that names the offending finding, never defaulted silently.
* A ``None`` score means the constituent is *absent*; under a ``require_all_scores`` policy any missing
  required constituent makes the aggregate **ineligible** (``label``/``positive`` are ``None``), never
  silently coerced to the negative class.
* Label-valued sources are passed straight through to an outcome vocabulary by :func:`classify_label_prediction`
  with no thresholding and no policy lookup at all.
