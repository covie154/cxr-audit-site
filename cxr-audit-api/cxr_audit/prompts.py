sys_role_msg = '''You are a helpful medical assistant.
Your task is to classify chest X-ray reports according to the following grading system:
Grading (R):
1 = normal without any findings
2 = normal variant, does NOT require follow up
3 = abnormal, non-urgent follow-up required
4 = abnormal, potentially important finding
5 = critical, urgent follow-up required

Grade 5 should be used for newly-diagnosed, critical, life threatening findings, including:
- Pneumothorax
- Aortic dissection
- Mediastinal emphysema
- Pneumoperitoneum
- Portal venous air
- Dilated bowel loops
- Significant tube or line misplacement e.g. malpositioned NGT

Grade 5 should also be used for newly-diagnosed, unexpected, life-changing findings, including:
- New lesions that are suspicious for malignancy
- New fracture
- New large volume pleural effusions
- New aneurysm

Grade 3 is for other abnormal findings, in particular:
- Atelectasis (new or stable)
- Calcification (new or stable)
- Cardiomegaly (new or stable)
- Fibrosis (new or stable)
- Scarring (new or stable)
- Nodule (stable or nonspecific, not concerning for malignancy)

Grade 4 should be used for any finding that has significant clinical impact (i.e. would require treatment) \
that is new or worsening (save for those to be graded as 2, as below).

Please provide your answer in a valid JSON, according to the defined format. Do not include any additional text or explanations.'''

# This Python code snippet defines a template string using the `Template` class from the `string`
# module. The template string contains detailed instructions for a task related to analyzing X-ray
# reports.
Below is a sample of an X-ray report, enclosed in <report> tags. 

<report>
${rpt}
</report>

Please generate a list of positive findings from the report, and whether the finding is new, better, worse or stable. 
Also, please specify if any medical devices (tubes & lines) are present in the report and their placement, whether it is satisfactory or malpositioned.
Medical devices should not be in "findings" but in "devices". If there is no medical device, please return an empty list for "devices_all" ([]).
Mastectomy, surgical clips and surgical plates should be considered as findings and not as medical devices.

Please choose the finding from this list. \
Use only the term that best fits the finding. \
Do not return a finding that is not in this list. \
List all positive findings only. Negative findings should not be included.

Here is the list of findings: ${padchest_findings_str}

Here is a list of medical devices (tubes & lines): ${tubes_lines_findings_str}

Here is a list of overarching diagnoses: ${diagnoses_str}

Here is a description of the parameters:
For the anatomical findings
- finding: Pathological finding mentioned in the report, using the list above. Do not return a finding that is not in this list. If you think the finding is not in this list, return the closest one from the list.
- location: Location of the finding, e.g. right lower zone
- system: System of the body where the finding is located -- Lung, Pleura, Heart, Mediastinum, MSK, Abdomen
- temporal: new, better, worse, stable or not mentioned
- uncertainty: certain, uncertain, not mentioned
If there are no findings, return an empty list for "findings_all" ([]).

For the medical devices (tubes & lines)
- medical_device: Name of the tube/line, using the list above. Do not return a device that is not in this list.
- placement: Placement of the tube/line -- satisfactory, suboptimal (abnormal but no urgent action is required), malpositioned (urgent repositioning or removal is required) or not mentioned
If there are no medical devices, return an empty list for "devices_all" ([]).

For the diagnoses
- diagnosis: Overarching diagnosis suggested in the report, using the list above. Do not return a diagnosis that is not in this list.
    - For example, if "...suggestive of infection" is mentioned, return "pneumonia" as the diagnosis.
    - For example, if "...may be related to infection" is mentioned, return "pneumonia" as the diagnosis.
    - For example, if "...malignancy cannot be excluded" is mentioned, return "malignancy" as the diagnosis.
    - For example, if "...P1 for..." is mentioned, return "P1" as the diagnosis.
- temporal: new, better, worse, stable or not mentioned
If there are no diagnoses, return an empty list for "diagnoses_all" ([]).

# Finer Points
If the heart size is not accurately assessed, this should NOT be considered as a finding.
If the only finding is that there is no consolidation or pleural effusion with no other findings, this should be considered as a normal report with no finding. \
Even if "no consolidation" or "no pleural effusion" is qualified, for example "no confluent consolidation", \
"no large pleural effusion" or "no frank pleural effusion" \
this should be considered as a normal report with no finding.
If a finding is "probably", "suggestive of", "likely" or any other similar phrase that indicates a low uncertainty, \
this should be considered as a finding with "certain" uncertainty.
If a finding is "possibly", "may represent", "could be", "cannot be excluded" \
or any other similar phrase that indicates a high uncertainty, this should be considered as a finding with "uncertain" uncertainty.
A rotated or suboptimally inspired film can be considered as "suboptimal study".
Findings written in pleural should be considered as singular (e.g. "pleural effusions" as "pleural effusion", "nodular opacities" as "nodular opacity", "granulomas" as "granuloma").

If the report suggests the possibility of a diagnosis of pneumonia, infection, or suggests correlation with infective markers, this diagnosis should be raised.
If the report suggests the possibility of a diagnosis of tuberculosis, atypical infection or mycobacterial infection, this diagnosis should be raised.
If the report suggests the possibility of a tumour, malignancy, or neoplasm, this diagnosis should be raised.
    - If a CT thorax was suggested for an opacity, the diagnosis is "malignancy".
If the reporting radiologist indicated at the end that the report is "P1", this diagnosis should be raised.
    - This can come in the format "P1 for X", or "Dr xx was informed at the time of reporting".
    - This should not be raised if there is no indication that the report is P1, for example if findings are all stable or have resolved.
    
If the report suggests that a diagnosis "cannot be excluded", it should be considered as a positive diagnosis.
If the report suggests that a diagnosis from the diagnoses list is "possible", it should be considered as a positive diagnosis.

Below is a chest X-ray report, enclosed in <report> tags. \
Please grade the report on a scale of 1 to 6.
Return the highest grade of the findings in the report.

# Finer Points
Any finding that has significant clinical impact that is new or worsening should be graded as 4 \
(save for those to be graded as 2, as below).
If the chronicity of a finding is not mentioned, it should be considered as new.
If a finding is "probably" X, it should be considered as X.
If there is no finding in the body of the report, even though there is a comparison, \
this should be graded as 1.
The presence of a comparison should NOT affect the grading of the report.

Unfolded aorta, vascular calcifications, chronic bone findings and an unfolded thoracic aorta do NOT need any follow up and should be graded as 2.
Benign findings also do NOT require follow up and should be graded as 2.
Patient rotation and suboptimal effort do NOT require follow up and should be graded as 2.
If there is suboptimal technique with no other finding, this should be graded as 2.

Pleural thickening, atelectasis and fibrosis should be grade 3.
Isolated cardiomegaly can be graded as 3.
Pulmonary calcifications like granulomas, pleural plaques and calcified adenopathy, if these are the only findings, \
should be graded as 3.
Pulmonary nodules should be graded as 3 even if they are stable, unless they are concerning for malignancy, \
in which case they should be graded as 4.

Potential infection/consolidation and possible fluid overload or pulmonary congestion should be graded as 4.
Patchy opacities, airspace opacities and hazy opacities should be graded as 4 for new pneumonia/infection.
A small pleural effusion can be graded as 3, but significant ones (moderate/severe) should be graded as 4.
If the report suggests the possibility of a diagnosis of pneumonia, infection, or suggests correlation with infective markers, this should be graded as 4.
If the report suggests the possibility of a diagnosis of tuberculosis, atypical infection or mycobacterial infection, this should be graded as 4.
    - If the report suggests that tuberculosis is stable, this should be graded as 3.
If the report suggests the possibility of a tumour, malignancy, or neoplasm, this should be graded as 4.
    - If the report suggests that the tumour is stable, this should be graded as 3.
If the reporting radiologist indicated at the end that the report is "P1", this should be graded as 5.
    - This can come in the format "P1 for X", or "Dr xx was informed at the time of reporting".

Any line present should be at least grade 3 (unless malpositioned, in which case it should be grade 6)
    - A nasogastric tube in a satisfactory position can be grade 3
    - Any other line should be at least grade 4 (because they're seen in critically ill pts)
    - Malpositioned lines are all grade 5.
